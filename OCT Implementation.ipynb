    "## Guidance on Using the OCT Package\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Optimal Classification Tree (OCT)** is an interpretable decision tree model formulated as a mixed-integer programming (MIP) problem. It determines the optimal splits by solving an optimization problem over the treeâ€™s structure, using warm-start values from a Classification and Regression Tree (CART) to initialize the split decision variables (`a`) and thresholds (`b`).\n",
    "\n",
    "The `optimal_classification_tree` package implements key functions for training the OCT and data preprocessing tools specifically for importing data from UCI Machine Learning Repository (such that there are no missing values and each column of data is normalized). This notebook demonstrates how to implement the OCT model and benchmark it against standard classifiers such as **CART**, **XGBoost**, and **Random Forest**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Data Preparation\n",
    "\n",
    "Start by importing the relevant functions from the `optimal_classification_tree` package and other classification models. The OCT class function allows us to plot the tree structure when the package `graphvi` is installed and added to our system path. Specify the following:\n",
    "- `data_id`: the dataset ID from UCIMLREPO,\n",
    "- `k_folds`: the number of folds for cross-validation,\n",
    "- `D`: the depth of the OCT tree.\n",
    "- `n`: randomly extract n observations if the original dataset is too large. \n",
    "\n",
    "and Use the `oct_tts` class to import a dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository and create cross-validation folds. \n",
    "\n",
    "Example usage:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "dt = oct_tts(data_id, k_folds,n)\n",
    "df_train = dt.df_train #train set: 50% of each k_folds splits. \n",
    "df_cal = dt.df_cal #calibration set: 25% of each split. \n",
    "df_test = dt.df_test #test set: 25% of each split. \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.Fitting the OCT Model\n",
    "\n",
    "The balanced OCT model (where each node is forced to split) can be fit on a training set as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "oct_model = bal_OCT(df_train[i], df_test[i], D)\n",
    "```\n",
    "Arguments:\n",
    "- `df_train[i]`: the i-th training set,\n",
    "- `df_test[i]`: the i-th test set,\n",
    "- `D`: the tree depth.\n",
    "\n",
    "If no warm-start is provided, the function internally fits a CART tree and uses its splits to warm-start the optimization.\n",
    "To provide custom warm-starts:\n",
    "- `warmstart_a`: a list of length \\( $2^D$ - 1 \\), where each entry indicates the feature index used to split at a branch node.\n",
    "- `warmstart_b`: a list of threshold values for the chosen feature at each branch node.\n",
    "\n",
    "The OCT model can be fit on a training set as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "oct_model = OCT_Main(df_train[i], df_test[i], D, alpha)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Model Evaluation\n",
    "After training, evaluate the in-sample and out-of-sample classification accuracy\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "oct_model.oct_accuracy_train  # OCT in-sample accuracy\n",
    "oct_model.cart_accuracy_train # CART in-sample accuracy\n",
    "```\n",
    "To visualize the tree structure, use the following (requires Graphviz installed and configured on your system path):\n",
    "```python\n",
    "oct_model.plot_tree_structure()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "More conveniently, one may choose to calibrate $\\alpha$ by cross validation through setting `tuning_problem = 0` or calibrate $C$ by cross validation through setting `tuning_problem = 1` or simply training the balanced OCT model (where in this case, tuning_problem = None) and view the prediction accuracies by calling the following function: \n",
    "```python\n",
    "OCT(data_id,D,k_folds,n=None,tuning_problem=None,alpha=None)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Benchmarking with Other Classifiers\n",
    "This notebook also benchmarks the OCT against XGBoost and Random Forest classifiers using the same cross-validation splits.\n",
    "Refer to the corresponding sections of the notebook for details on training and evaluating these models."
